| 🔄 Convert | Format Interconversion | xlsx ↔ csv ↔ json ↔ tsv, auto-encoding detection |
| 📎 Consolidate | Merge / Split / Split by Column | Multi-file merge, split by sheet or column value |
| 🔗 Relate | VLOOKUP / Dedup | Cross-table join, smart dedup keeping latest |
| 🧹 Clean | Data Cleaning / Validation | Empty row cleanup, format standardization, rule validation |

| 🔍 Compare | Diff / Image Insert | Row-by-row comparison, batch image insertion |
| 🔒 Secure | Password Protection | File-level encrypt/decrypt |

### ⚡ Large File Ready — 100K+ Rows Streaming

Not "load everything into memory first" — automatically detects file size and seamlessly switches to streaming mode for files exceeding 100,000 rows:

- **Read**: Auto-enables read_only mode, memory usage reduced by 90%+
- **Write**: Auto-enables write_only mode, generates and writes on-the-fly
- **Error Tolerance**: Skips bad rows/cells and continues, summarizes errors at the end

### 🧹 8 Data Cleaning Rules

The most common dirty data problems in HR and business scenarios, solved with one command:

1. Remove empty rows/columns
2. Trim leading/trailing whitespace
3. Standardize phone numbers to 11-digit format
4. Unify dates to YYYY-MM-DD
5. Standardize currency/amount formats
6. Validate ID card number format
7. Validate email format
8. Flag duplicate records

### 📐 5 Output Formats

All scripts uniformly support multi-format output for different downstream scenarios:

| Format | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| json | API integration / programmatic access |
| csv | Lightweight exchange / import to other systems |
| markdown | Documentation embedding / quick reading |
| table | Terminal display |
| xlsx | Standard Excel output |

### 🔒 File-Level Encryption

Sensitive files like salary tables and performance data — one command to encrypt, one command to decrypt:

- Set / modify / remove passwords
- Based on msoffcrypto-tool with standard Office encryption
- Compatible with Microsoft Office / WPS / LibreOffice

## 📌 Comparison

### mu-excel-toolbox vs Manual Excel Operations

| Dimension | mu-excel-toolbox | Manual |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Merge 10 reports | 1 command, seconds | Copy-paste one by one, 10-30 min |
| Split by department | 1 command, auto-split | Filter → Copy → New → Paste, repeat N times |
| Data cleaning | 8 rules, one click | Manual find-and-replace, error-prone |
| VLOOKUP | Auto-match + export | Write formula → drag → debug, fragile |
| Diff comparison | Row-by-row + change report | Eyeball comparison, breaks at 100+ rows |
| Batch template fill | Data + template → batch generate | Edit one by one, repetitive labor |
| Large file handling | Streaming mode, no crash | Excel freezes on open |

### mu-excel-toolbox vs Writing Python Scripts Yourself

| Dimension | mu-excel-toolbox | DIY Scripts |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Barrier to entry | Natural language, no code needed | Requires Python + openpyxl/pandas |
| Feature coverage | 22 tools out of the box | Write from scratch each time |
| Large file handling | Auto-streaming | Implement streaming logic yourself |
| Error handling | Built-in tolerance + error report | Debug each bug yourself |
| Encoding issues | Auto-detect UTF-8/GBK/GB2312 | Classic UnicodeDecodeError nightmare |
| Safety backup | Auto-backup before write | Overwrite and it's gone |
| Maintenance | Skill unified updates | Scattered scripts, unmaintained |

pip install -r ./mu-excel-toolbox/scripts/requirements.txt
```

**Step 2: Start Using**

Just tell your AI agent what you want to do — the skill auto-routes to the right tool:

```
# Preview a file
"Show me what's in sales.xlsx"

# Merge multiple reports
"Merge January.xlsx through December.xlsx into an annual summary"

# Clean + validate
"Clean this roster's dirty data, check phone and email formats"

# Generate a chart
"Create a monthly bar + line combo chart from the sales data"
```

> 💡 First run auto-installs dependencies (~30 seconds), then it's ready to go.
